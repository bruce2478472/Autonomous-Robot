# Autonomous-Robot

Liaised with team members to construct a fully autonomous robot as a part of my MSc in Aritifical Intelligence: this involved constructing motors and sensors together and programming control routines (C++) for navigation and image recognition for completing tasks around a pre-set arena.

The robot was designed and programmed to avoid walls through infrared sensors and localise its position by recognising unique images placed in the four arena quadrants. The final task was to discover specific cubes (labelled with further unique images) and relocate them to a pre-defined location within the arena.
